## User Story

```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Provides the server-side environment to run JavaScript code, enabling the development of scalable and high-performance applications.
- **Express.js**: A fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js, used to create and manage routes for API endpoints and handle HTTP requests/responses efficiently.
- **MongoDB**: A flexible NoSQL database used to store and manage user, thought, and reaction data in a document-oriented format.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB that facilitates data modeling, schema validation, and seamless interaction with the MongoDB database.
- **Nodemon**: A development tool that automatically restarts the Node.js server when file changes are detected, improving development workflow and efficiency.
- **Moment.js**: A popular JavaScript library used for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates and times, ensuring accurate and consistent handling of timestamp data throughout the application.
- **Insomnia**: A powerful API client used to test and interact with the API endpoints, allowing developers to send HTTP requests and view responses in various formats.

## Features

- **User Management**:

  - Provides comprehensive control over user accounts, including the ability to retrieve a list of all users, create new users, update existing user details, and delete users from the database.
  - Includes friend list management, allowing users to build, maintain, and manage their list of friends, reflecting real-world social networks.

- **Thought Management**:

  - Enables users to share their thoughts with the community by creating, updating, or deleting thoughts.
  - Offers the ability to retrieve thoughts posted by any user, facilitating the viewing and interaction with user-generated content.

- **Reaction Management**:

  - Allows users to engage with specific thoughts by adding reactions, similar to likes or comments in a typical social network.
  - Reactions can be added or removed, providing dynamic interaction between users.

- **Friend List Management**:

  - Users can enhance their social connections by adding friends to their friend list, enabling easy access to friends' thoughts and interactions.
  - Friendships can be managed by adding or removing friends from a user's list, keeping the network relevant and up-to-date.

- **NoSQL Database**:

  - Leverages MongoDB to handle large amounts of unstructured data efficiently, providing flexibility in data storage and retrieval.
  - The schema-less nature of MongoDB allows for rapid development and scalability, essential for growing social networks.

## Installation

To install the NoSQL Social Network API, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vaughanknouse/Social-Network-API.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
    cd Social-Network-API
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Install MongoDB**: Ensure that MongoDB is installed on your machine to initialize the database. If MongoDB is not yet installed, refer to the [MongoDB installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb).
5. **Install Insomnia**: Ensure that Insomnia or a similar API client for route testing is also installed on your machine. If not yet installed, download Insomnia from the [Insomnia download page](https://insomnia.rest/download).

## Usage

After completing the installation, follow these steps to use the NoSQL Social Network API:

1. **Start the server**: Invoke the application using the following command:

   ```bash
    npm start
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you want the server to automatically restart whenever changes are saved, use the command `npm run dev` instead:

2. **API Route Testing**: For detailed instructions on testing API routes using Insomnia, refer to the "Tests" section of this `README.md`.

### Screenshots: \*\*\*

## Tests

Use Insomnia or a similar API client to test the following API routes:

- **Users**

  - GET `/api/users`: Retrieve all users.
  - GET `/api/users/:id`: Retrieve a single user by `_id` along with their associated thoughts and friends.
  - POST `/api/users`: Create a new user.
  - PUT `/api/users/:id`: Update a user by `_id`.
  - DELETE `/api/users/:id`: Delete a user by `_id` and remove their associated thoughts.

- **Friends**

  - POST `/api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId`: Add a friend to a user's friend list.
  - DELETE `/api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId`: Remove a friend from a user's friend list.

- **Thoughts**

  - GET `/api/thoughts`: Retrieve all thoughts.
  - GET `/api/thoughts/:id`: Retrieve a single thought by `_id`.
  - POST `/api/thoughts`: Create a new thought.
  - PUT `/api/thoughts/:id`: Update a thought by `_id`.
  - DELETE `/api/thoughts/:id`: Delete a thought by `_id`.

- **Reactions**

  - POST `/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions`: Create and add a reaction to a thought.
  - DELETE `/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions/:reactionId`: Remove a reaction from a thought by its `_id`.
